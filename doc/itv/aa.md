I have more than 10 years of development experience, mainly in back-end Java development, 
and also have several years of front-end development experience. I have been with xx company 
for more than 2 years and joined this project team a few months ago. My current job is mainly 
to participate in the construction of a data platform. This is a brand-new project. It is 
mainly to provide a unified platform for financial data reporting and analysis, including 
model calculation management, various table and graphic display, and other third-party systems. 
Integration, the project is still in the initial stage, the project may be deployed locally 
or on a cloud platform, that's about it, thank you.
我有10多年的开发经验， 主要是后端Java开发，也有几年前端开发经验，加入xx公司2年多了，几个月前加入这个项目组。
现在的工作主要是参与一个数据平台的搭建，这个是一个全新的项目，主要是为金融数据报表和分析提供一个统一的平台，
包含模型计算管理，各种表格图形展现，以及和第三方其他系统的集成，项目还在初始阶段，项目可能会部署在本地或者云平台上面，
大概就是这些，谢谢。

### you act as a senior developer interviewer. we need to hire a senior developer with great technique skills, honest, willing to learn new things, teamplayer, openminded. What questions your would ask?
Here are some questions I might ask as a senior developer interviewer looking to assess technical skills, honesty, willingness to learn, teamwork, and open-mindedness:

#### Technical Skills:
- What projects have you worked on that showcase your development abilities and experience with various languages, frameworks, databases, etc?
- Describe a technically complex feature or system you designed and implemented recently. What were some of the constraints and considerations? What technologies did you use and why?
- How do you stay up-to-date on the latest languages, frameworks, and best practices in software development?

#### Honesty:
- Tell me about a time you made a mistake on a project. What was the situation and how did you handle it?
- Describe a situation where you had to choose between doing something the quick way or pushing to do it the right way. What was your approach and what was the outcome?

#### Willingness to Learn:
- What new technologies or programming languages have you learned recently? What motivated you to learn them?
- What resources do you rely on to keep expanding your software development knowledge?

#### Teamwork:
- Tell me about a time you had to collaborate closely with other developers on a project. What was your role and how did you ensure smooth teamwork?
- Describe a situation where you had to compromise with a teammate or adjust your work to fit with the team's objectives. How did you handle it?

#### Open-Mindedness:
- Tell me about a time your viewpoint was changed on an aspect of software development or computing technology. What made you change your perspective?
- Describe a situation where you had to consider an approach to a technical problem that was new or unfamiliar to you. How open were you to learning and trying it?

The types of follow-up questions would depend on their responses, but I would aim to deeply assess communication skills, problem-solving abilities, analytical thinking, and learning attitude.
